        <h2>Introduction to Final Fantasy</h2>
        <p>
          Final Fantasy is a fantasy role-playing video game created by Hironobu
          Sakaguchi, developed and first published in Japan by Square (now
          Square Enix) in 1987 for the Famicom. It is the first game in Square's
          Final Fantasy series. Originally released for the Nintendo
          Entertainment System, Final Fantasy was remade for the MSX2 and
          WonderSwan Color. It was later released on the Game Boy Advance as
          part of a compilation called Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls. In
          2009, it was released for the Wii via the Wii Virtual Console service.
          It was later made available on iOS.

          The story follows four youths called the Light Warriors, who each
          carry one of their world's four elemental orbs which have been
          darkened by the four Elemental Fiends. Together, they quest to defeat
          these evil forces, restore light to the orbs, and save their world.

          The game received generally positive reviews, and it is regarded as
          one of the most influential and successful role-playing games on the
          Nintendo Entertainment System, playing a major role in popularizing
          the genre. Praise focused on the game's graphics, while criticism
          targeted the time spent wandering in search of random battle
          encounters to raise the player's experience level. All versions of
          Final Fantasy sold a combined total of two million copies worldwide by
          March 2003.
