            <p>This walkthrough intends to create the be all end all guide for completing the original Final Fantasy most optimally.</p>

        <div id="walkthrough-heading">1. Cornelia & Getting Equipped</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/Cornelia-map.png" alt="Cornelia Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            You’ll begin on the world map, spawned right outside the castle and town of Cornelia. However, you’ll spawn into the world relatively weak and vulnerable, so walk north into town. 
            At the very least you can talk to people including the King to get a handle on the story, but the real reason you’re here is to shop. Use your limited starting cash supply to buy some basic gear from the stores. There’s Weapon, Armor, and Item Shops, plus separate stores selling Black and White Magic.
            Throughout this guide, you can consult our FF1 weapon guide and FF1 Magic List to see what's available to you at any given point, and where from.
            There's also Cornelia Castle itself. There'll be some doors and chests you can't open at this stage, but there's still one or two items to be found. Here's the maps:
            Cornelia Castle 1F
            Cornelia Castle 2F
            We recommend that you buy what you need from the shops, and then head out into the overworld. Don’t actually go anywhere - hover around Cornelia and get into some random encounters. Fight, and win. 
            We recommend going to level 2 or 3 at least. When weakened or when ready, head back to town. You’ll want to rest at the Inn there to heal up, and then spend any further cash you have spare on extra gear or items. 
            Whenever you’re ready, it’s time to move on…
        </div>
        
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">2. Garland & the Chaos Shrine</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/Chaos-Shrine-map.png" alt="Chaos Shrine Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            Just to the north of Cornelia is your next destination, an evil shrine that's known as either the Temple of Fiends, Temple of Chaos, or Chaos Shrine - depending on the version you're playing. When you enter, the boss will be waiting for you, right in front of you - but you don’t have to fight him straight away.
If you head to the left you’ll be able to find a few treasure chests on a couple of side paths. The paths to the right are locked at this stage in the game. When ready, step on up to your first boss… Garland.
When the time comes, head North from the entrance to face the first boss. [Boss Battle: GARLAND]
After the battle, the Princess is rescued. A bridge is opened to the North. Talk to Princess Sarah to get a LUTE, a key item.
        </div>
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">3. Witch Matoya & Pravoca Town</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/pravoka.png" alt="Cornelia Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            After going across the new bridge, head to the north as much as you can. There’s a cave around here - Matoya’s Cave. It has great music. Matoya is a Witch, and needs a Crystal Eye to restore her sight. Explore, grab some items, and then head East.
Eventually, you'll reach the town of Pravoca. Here's the Pravoca Town Map, not that you'll need it.
Help the Townspeople out by agreeing to rid the town of the Pirates. [Boss Battle: PIRATES]
For beating the Pirates, you’ll get access to a ship. Remember that Pravoca has level 2 spells for sale, as well as new gear - stock up before leaving.
        </div>
        
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">4. Open Seas to Elfheim</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/Elfheim-map.png" alt="Chaos Shrine Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            Now you have your ship, you can head to the next destination - Elfheim. Before you do, however, a quick note on the ship…
There’s a mini-game you can access once you have the ship. This can be used to stock up on lots of gold, and you can repeat it. 
Completing the mini-game can reward anything from  items up to 10,000 Gil. It’s a simple sliding puzzle. Clear it in under 2 minutes for 2000 Gil, under 1 minute for 5000, or under 30 seconds for 10,000. Here’s how to access the game:
NES: While on the ship, press A & B together 55 times.
PS1 Origins: On the ship, press X & Circle together 55 times.
GBA Dawn of Souls: While on the ship, press A & B together 22 times.
PSP 20th Anniversary: On the ship, press X & Circle together 22 times.
2018 Mobile: On the ship, press & hold the screen with one finger and then tap 23 times while holding. 
HD Pixel Remaster: Press and hold the cancel button (IE B on an Xbox Controller, Circle on a PS Controller) and repreatedly press the Confirm button (IE A / Cross) until the game appears. The Pixel Remaster version of the game has no rewards other than an achievement. 
When you’re ready, to get to Elfheim you should go back to Cornelia’s dock with the ship, then head south with the ship until you hit land. When you do hit land, head west. Exit at the next dock, and then go south on foot to find Elfheim.
In Elfheim you’ll find more townsfolk with problems you can solve, plus new weapons and magic to buy. 
Be aware the next dungeon is poison-tastic, so you might want to stock up on potions and Antidotes.
Go to the Castle and discover the door is locked. You need to get the Crown for the Prince - and that’s to the West. 
        </div>
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">5.  Marsh Cave - Retrieving the Crown</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/marsh_cave_dungeon_map_1.png" alt="Cornelia Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            Leave Elfheim and head West. Once you hit the shore, go South again. Eventually you’ll find the entrance to the Marsh Cave, your next dungeon. Here's the Marsh Cave Dungeon Maps:
March Cave 1F Map
Marsh Cave 2Fa Map
Marsh Cave 2Fb Map
Marsh Cave 3F Map
The Marsh Cave is made up of four maps - and some are quite large. Work your way through the dungeon. Here’s ancient maps for the NES version we made some 10+ years ago:
On the final level, you’ll face off against some demonic enemies. [Boss Battle: PISCODEMON]
Once they’re defeated, open the chest to get the CROWN. With it in hand, make your way back to Elfheim.
        </div>
        
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">6. The Crystal Eye, Jolt Tonic, Mystic Key, and Nitro Powder</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/Elfheim-map.png" alt="Chaos Shrine Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            Head back to the town of Elfheim, tracing your steps back. You should heal up and stock up on items as needed as soon as you get back to the town. 
North-West of Elfheim is the Western Keep. Go here and you’ll find another sorta-powerful foe. [Boss Battle: ASTOS]
Defeating Astos will net you the CRYSTAL EYE that Matoya wanted to restore her sight. You know what’s next - make your way back to Matoya. To be safe, consider stopping off at Elfheim to heal before using the boat to go back to Cornelia and then north to Matoya’s Cave.
Giving Matoya the Crystal Eye will get you the JOLT TONIC. This can wake Elfheim’s Prince, so…
Head back to Elfheim, and give the Jolt Tonic to the Prince’s assistant.Once the Prince is restored, you will be given the MYSTIC KEY, a very handy key item.
At this stage, you can backtrack to numerous areas to get some great items from chests and rooms you couldn’t open before but now can with the Mystic Key.
First, gead back to Cornelia and hit up the Castle there to get many weapons and armor, all of which are very useful. There’s also NITRO POWDER (TNT in some versions), an item required for progression very shortly, so you may as well get it now.
The other Mystic Key items are optional: 
Return to the Temple of Chaos to get 2 weapons and a nice item.
In the Elfheim Castle you can get weapons and cash.
Return to the Western Keep to the north-west for a couple of weapons and an armor piece.
Back at the Mash Cave dungeon you can get cash, a weapon, and armor piece.
        </div>
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">7. Mt. Duergar & Melmond</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/Melmond-map.png" alt="Cornelia Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            Once you’re done gathering any items with the Mystic Key, you can head back to your boat and travel West of Cornelia - there’s a port waiting for you westwards that’s not far from Mt. Duergar, your next destination. In older versions of the game, this was simply known as the Dwarf Cave. Here's the Mt. Duergar / Dwarf Cave map.
Dock at the port and then head to the mountain. There’s some items you can grab here, some of which must be unlocked with the Mystic Key.
This is where the NITRO POWDER you picked up earlier comes into play. A dwarf in the mountain can be given this key item, and he’ll use it to blast a hole in the world - and that hole can be used to sail your ship onwards to new destinations. 
Take your ship through the not-so-carefully crafted gap. Right on through this gap you’ll find the town of Melmond, which is your next major destination. Unfortunately, Melmond isn’t in the greatest of conditions. Still, there’s some new weapons, armor, and spells available for sale in Melmond - you might want to pick some up. Here's the Melmond Town Map.
There’s a lot of enemies in the next area that can inflict Petrification, so pick up Gold Needle items in order to cure yourself. Next up - the Terra Cavern, aka the Cavern of the Earth!
Head west along the nearby coast to reach the entrance to the Terra Cavern.
        </div>
        
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">8. Cavern of the Earth & the Vampire</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/terra_cavern_dungeon_map_l1.png" alt="Chaos Shrine Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            The next step of your quest takes you to the Cavern of the Earth, which in some versions of FF1 is also known as the Terra Cavern or Earth Cave. This is a five-floor dungeon that is home to one of FF1’s Elemental Fiends, some of the most significant enemies in the game. The floors:
            Cavern of the Earth L1
            Cavern of the Earth L2
            Cavern of the Earth L3
            Levels 4 & 5 come in your next visit!
            This is a sprawling dungeon full of treasure and branching paths, as you can see from the NES-era maps. You can go in many directions when you first enter, and though heading to the East will lead you towards your objective, you might want to explore further.
            Work your way through the dungeon - eventually, you’ll come across a doorway at the end of an otherwise dead end. Through the door, you’ll find a new boss battle. [Boss Battle: VAMPIRE].
            Defeat the Vampire in order to get the STAR RUBY. This is an easy boss encounter, as since he’s an undead enemy you can cast restorative spells on him to deal damage.
            After getting the Star Ruby from the chest, backtrack and leave the dungeon - you can’t go any further for now. 
        </div>
        <div id="walkthrough-heading"> 9. The Sage, Terra Cavern II, & Lich</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/terra_cavern_dungeon_map_l4.png" alt="Chaos Shrine Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            Once you’re out of the Terra Cavern with the ruby in hand, you need to head to Titan’s Cave. There might not be any summons in FF1, but some familiar faces show up in this way!
Inside the Titan’s Cave, give the STAR RUBY to the Titan. The Titan will move aside and let you into areas to pick up some treasure. Do that.
Leave the Titan’s Cave through the exit to the left of the area behind the Titan. Follow this route to the Sage’s Cave and chat to the Sage inside. He gives you the EARTH ROD. 
Now it’s time to head back to the Terra Cavern. You might want to stop off at Melmond first to heal - then return to where you battled the Vampire boss. With the Earth Rod, you can now proceed - in some versions, you’ll need to actually use the Earth Rod on the stone tile at the dead end to open up the next area:
Cavern of the Earth L4
Cavern of the Earth L5
Keep working through the Terra Cavern. Eventually, a door will lead to a final room where there’s the Earth Crystal and a challenging battle. [Boss Battle: LICH, FIEND OF EARTH].
With the Lich defeated, your work in the Terra Cavern is done. You can explore the dungeon for more treasure if you like, or leave. Don’t forget you can teleport out with a portal in the Crystal Room.
        </div>
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">10.  Crescent Lake, Mount Gulg, & Marilith</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/Cresent-Lake-map.png" alt="Cornelia Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            You need to head back to your ship, and you may as well go via Melmond. Use Melmond to heal up, then take your ship south, following the coast and ignoring the path Titan made up. Eventually you’ll be able to travel east - do so until you reach a port.
            This port is just to the north of Crescent Lake, a new town. Head south to reach it. As ever, check out the weapon, armor, and spell stores, and stock up on perishable items. 
            Use the hidden path in the top-right corner of the Crescent Lake town map to reach a unique clearing on the east where there’s a bunch of Sages. Talk to all 12 Sages and they’ll give you a CANOE.
            The Canoe is another world map travel upgrade; it lets you walk across shallow water like rivers. There’s an obvious path to follow right outside Crescent Lake - do that to be led to the foot of a volcano - Mt Gulg, your next dungeon. In other versions, this was also known as Gurgu Volcano.
            Mt. Gulg is a dungeon with a gimmick - and that gimmick is “liquid hot magma”. Lava. You can walk on the Lava to avoid random encounters - but every step deals damage to you. Walking on Lava is a necessity to make your way through this dungeon, but exactly how much you do it is your choice. Here's the dungeon map:
            Mt. Gulg L1 Map
            Mt. Gulg L2 Map
            Mt. Gulg L3 Maps: L3A / L3B
            Mt. Gulg L4 Maps: L4A / L4B
            Mt. Gulg L5 Map
            Partway through the dungeon you'll have a forced encounter against a dragon enemy. It's not quite a boss, but let's list it as one anyway. [Boss Battle: RED DRAGON].
            There’s a fair amount of treasure throughout this dungeon, but it’s quite manageable to get through. Just remember to keep topping up your health with items whenever the lava and encounters whittle it down. 
            The final area of the Mount Gulg is a room with eight different directions, with you starting in the middle. Many directions have treasure, but South-West is where you’ll find the next big battle. [Boss Battle: MARILITH, FIEND OF FIRE].
            Once Marilith is down, do what you’ve gotta with the Fire Crystal and then exit the dungeon. Again, you can explore more if you want - or use the teleporter in the crystal room.
        </div>
        
        <div id="walkthrough-heading">11. Ice Cavern & How to get the Airship</div>
        <img id="walkthrough-image" src="images/ice_cave_l1.png" alt="Chaos Shrine Map">
        <div id="walkthrough-text">
            From fire to ice - the Ice Cavern now awaits as your next destination. Go back to Crescent Lake to heal, then return to your boat. Follow the coast to the north, and eventually you’ll reach a port. Now take the shallow waters to get to yet another cave dungeon.
This is a pretty simple dungeon, and is smaller than other recent ones. The gimmick here is cracks you can fall through to travel from one floor to the next. There are, naturally, a bunch of items scattered throughout the dungeon. There’s a lot of cash in particular - and since this dungeon’s boss is easy, you should explore and endure the random encounters. Here's the maps:
Ice Cavern L1
Ice Cavern L2 Maps: L2A / L2B
Ice Cavern L3 Maps: L3A / L3B
In one room, stepping on a crack near three chests will lead to the goal of the Ice Cavern, which is a room where you’ll fight the Evil Eye, one of the easiest bosses in all of FF1 - if you can even call it a boss [Boss Battle: EVIL EYE]. 
Once the Evil Eye is defeated, you can grab the LEVISTONE. This is a key item to continue. Leave the Ice Cavern. 
The Levistone is an important item because it lets you unlock a Final Fantasy staple - the airship! Go back to Crescent Lake, and then head South from there to find a wide open desert. This is the Lykion Desert, a key destination - and the start of a major FF tradition.
While standing in the desert, select and use the LEVISTONE from your menu. The AIRSHIP appears in the middle of the desert!
