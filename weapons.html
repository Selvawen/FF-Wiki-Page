        <p>
          Because it’s a much more simple game than later entries in the series,
          the weapon system in <strong>FF1</strong> is likewise much more
          simplistic. There are fewer weapons overall, and while they do fit
          into a few basic categories, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Swords</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Daggers</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Axes</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hammers</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Nunchaku</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Staves</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The weapon types don’t have much of an effect. Each individual weapon
          can be equipped by certain character classes and jobs - though this
          varies based on the weapon, not on the category.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there a Best Weapon in FF1?</h3>

        <p>
          Among all this, is there a best weapon in <strong>FF1</strong>? Well…
          yes and no. There is absolutely a best, most powerful weapon in the
          game - but it’s very limited and difficult to access.
        </p>

        <p>
          With that said, we can also note some other weapons that are
          particularly useful and worth having in your inventory:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Masamune</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Masamune</strong> is hands-down the best weapon in
          <strong>FF1</strong>. It’s unique in that it’s not just a hugely
          powerful sword, but it can be used by any character, regardless of
          class. That means you can even turn a White Mage healer into a
          powerful physical attacker. The Masamune is found as loot, but only in
          the game’s final dungeon.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Excalibur</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Excalibur</strong> is the second-best weapon in the game.
          Another sword, you can only obtain it if you get the rare
          <strong>Adamantite</strong> item from the Flying Fortress Dungeon,
          then trade it to the blacksmith in Mt. Duergar.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Long Sword</h3>
        <p>
          The best sword you can simply buy over-the-counter in a store is the
          <strong>Long Sword</strong>, which can be bought in Melmond for 1500
          Gil. However, there are plenty of better swords available as loot.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Black Belt/Master</h3>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, you shouldn’t worry about weapons for your
          <strong>Black Belt/Master</strong>. There are a couple of
          <strong>Nunchaku</strong> they can equip, but the Monk classes don’t
          have the same weapon-based progression as the other jobs. Soon enough
          they'll do more damage bare-handed than they would with a weapon.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Black Mage/Wizard</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re sticking to traditional Mage weapons for your
          <strong>Black Mage/Wizard</strong>, the best weapon is the
          <strong>Spellbinder</strong>, a powerful staff with a useful special
          effect.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Weapons Against Undead</h3>
        <p>
          There’s quite a lot of undead enemies in this game, including a couple
          of significant FF1 bosses. A few weapons, such as the
          <strong>Sunblade</strong> sword and <strong>Light Axe</strong>, are
          more effective against the Undead, and therefore particularly useful
          against several bosses and in several dungeons.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          With these notes given, and keeping in mind that this weapon guide
          only covers the content in the NES original and HD Pixel Remaster (any
          extra weapons from PS1/PSP/GBA etc, such as Ultima Weapon, are not in
          those versions), you should chase those weapons as a priority.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, honestly, you should always just buy the next best weapon
          available to you. It isn’t really tenable in <strong>FF1</strong> to
          target all the best weapons from early on. In fact, getting the best
          weapons in <strong>FF1</strong> is often about economy - you’ll also
          need money for spells, items, and armor - so it’s about budgeting for
          the best overall party setup.
        </p>

          Below, we list every weapon in the base version of the first Final
          Fantasy. The new HD Pixel Remaster version of FF1 is also based on the
          NES original, so this is also the weapon list for that game.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve broken it down by category: Swords, Daggers, Axes, Hammers,
          Nunchaku, and Staff-type magic weapons.
